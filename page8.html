<p2>Firstly, I want to adress that I created this website in order to thank you for everything. Thus, I will start off by saying , thank you. The following paragraph holds a summary of all my feelings for you. So, lets start from the beginning</p2>

<p3>I'll be honest the start is kinda hazy , however the one thing I am sure about was that by April you had started to form into a big part of my life. Kinda  crazy right. And with that we started our Memories. Visiting  cities. a shit ton of shopping, cute dates, chillin with our friends and also together and lastly spending time together at our houses vibin. Those menories will stay with me forever !</p3>
<p4>Moreover I feel lucky to have met and bonded with such a nice person. Your kindness and niceness are some of the traits that make you such an amazing unique person. Please, I beg you do not allow those traits to stop you from taking the best decision for yourself. Being selfish is good sometimes. Furthermore, I was truly suprised by your ability to always listen to my thoughts and ideas , and judge them in a very mature way. Hence , I am very grateful for your empathy which allowed you to look at my perpesctive during out small arguements. To sum up, your traits are unique and I hope they help you during your life , as well as help you grow into this amazing person who I know can manifest whatever they want throughout their life. 
</p4>
<p5>Additionally, i want you to understand how much you have helped me grow as a person. Throughout our relationship you helped me realize the signifigance of opening up to people close to me and sharing my thoughts and feelings. Whilst also you made it very easy for me to do this around you. Plus you made me understand how vulnerabiltiy is a major factor that keeps relationshiops healthy and strong. I've never been able to be vulnerable around people , you changed that. Please dont ever forget the importance of mutual growth in a relationship. And if you do forget , think about how we both became stronger individuals because of this relationship.
</p5>
<p6>Lastly, i want you in my life , and even though I won't see you everyday, i will always be here for you dummy. You never know what our future holds, hence this is not a goodbye. I hope you find your spanish prince. Thank you and enjoy the rest of the website</p6>
